    <h1>OOP  and factory functions in JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>four pillars of OOP</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Encapsulation</li><p>Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, such as a class in OOP.</p>
        <li>Abstraction</li><p>Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.</p>
        <li>Inheritance</li><p>Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class can inherit properties and methods from an existing class.</p>
        <li>Polymorphism</li><p>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.</p>
    </ul>
